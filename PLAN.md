# Plan

## Idea 📗

### Problem
Gathering the correct social media and blogging content specifications takes time, 
making it cumbersome to ensure AI generated content meets platform requirements during the initial setup of content systems or automation workflows.

### Solution
The idea is to have a program with an API and a UI that provides up-to-date content specification information of all social media and blogging platforms.

The program will do a few things:
1. 🔍 Keep track of platform specific spec changes in relevant webpages
2. 🤖 Parse and extract specs
3. 💾 Save the specs in a database
4. 🌐 Have API endpoints to get up-to-date specs

## Constraints 🧩

When taken together there are tons of socialmedia and blogging platforms, each with it's own features,
so for the sake of time and complexity we will limit initial specs in SpecToad to posting basic text and images.

In the beginning I'm going to include specs of the most commonly used social media platforms (X, Li, Fb, IG) and specific blogging platforms related to 'software', 'development', 'hacking', 'security', 'ai' etc. (I.e. techcrunch, hackernoon and similar) However, once code contributions are open, we will integrate more social media and blogging platforms content specs. 

PS: If you think including x, y or z is an absolute MUST, please let us know. We're open to suggestions. See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).
