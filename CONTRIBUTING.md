## Hello!

First of all, welcome to SpecToad. Happy to see you here.

SpecToad is currently in early development. While code contributions aren't open just yet, they will be very soon! 

However, in the meantime, both insights and non-code contribution are extremely valuable to us. There are several ways you can help shape the project now, so feel free to reach out and share anything you know.

## How You Can Help Now

- **Suggest platforms**: Which social media or blogging platforms should we prioritize?
- **Feature requests**: What would make SpecToad most useful for your workflow?
- **Spread the word**: Know others who might benefit? Share this [#buildinpublic](https://x.com/bart_ohm/status/1891975762158166035) journey!

## How to Contribute (Coming Soon)

Once the codebase is public, you'll be able to:
- Submit issues for new platform suggestions
- Contribute code for spec parsers
- Enhance API endpoints

- Test and report bugs
- And much more!
