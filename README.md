  <p>Creators Gateway to Content Specifications</p>
</div>

## About

This project will provide an API and UI for accessing up-to-date content specifications for various social media and blogging platforms (post types, character limits, image dimensions, upload sizes, etc, etc). It automatically tracks changes to platform guidelines, extracts specification information using AI, and makes this data available through simple API endpoints and a user-interface.

The goal is to help content creators and developers easily align AI-generated content with the requirements of different platforms to be able to set up automations quickly.

## Statement

This is a community project. Both plan and code will be open, and we encourage anyone to steal it. If you manage to build something quicker and nicer, by all means do so, but if you do, make sure it is and remains accessible. That's the whole point of sharing this. This project is about openness and accessibility.
